People who do not live close to the ocean face <strong>tough times</strong>. They say life is just better at the beach. Unfortunately Vienna is a little far from the Ocean.

At least in Vienna there is water. The river that runs through the city is called <strong>Donau or Danube</strong>.

So the most important aspect when living in Vienna is to live close to the river. Or at least somwhere, where public transport brings you quickly there. I figured there are three main stations right next to the Donau. <strong>U1 Neue Donau</strong>, <strong>U1 Donauinsel</strong> and <strong>U2 Donaustradtbr√ºcke</strong>

So I took 1000 Points and the HERE-Public tansport API to simluate how long it takes me to get to each of them if I leave my house on the 27th of May in 2023 at 12 (noon). These are the points and you can see the three stations.

This probably does not make any sense, but here you go!
